## Overview

This analysis provides a comprehensive geospatial examination of crime incidents across the study area. Using advanced GIS techniques and Python-based data visualization tools, we identify crime hotspots, analyze temporal patterns, and deliver actionable insights for law enforcement and urban planning.

The study employs statistical clustering methods, kernel density estimation, and temporal trend analysis to reveal significant patterns in criminal activity. Our findings highlight key high-risk zones and temporal windows that can inform resource allocation and strategic intervention planning.
